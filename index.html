                    to the Indian subcontinent.
                    Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary
                    substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.</p>

                Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing
                certain foods to this country.
                The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India.
                A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many
                regions of India.
                Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and
                Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.Spices were bought from India and traded
                around Europe and Asia.
                Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (especially
                Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius,
                Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.

                After 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between Fertile Crescent and Indus Valley (IV) seems
                to have occurred as a consequence of the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture.
                Around 7000 BCE, agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus Valley, and wheat and barley
                began to be grown. Sesame, and humped cattle were domesticated in the local farming communities.
                Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia. From circa
                4500 to 1900 BC the rulers of Lower Mesopotamia were Sumerians who spoke a non-Indo-European and
                non-Semitic language, may have initially come from India and may have been related to the original
                Dravidian population of India.
                By 3000 BCE, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in India.

                Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a
                variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), tuer (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and
                moong (mung beans).
                Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or
                dal, are used extensively. Some pulses, such as channa or cholae (chickpeas), rajma (kidney beans), and
                lobiya (black-eyed peas) are very common, especially in the northern regions.
                Channa and moong are also processed into flour (besan).
                Many Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India,
                mustard oil in eastern India, and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala and parts of
                southern Tamil Nadu.Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty
                aroma.
